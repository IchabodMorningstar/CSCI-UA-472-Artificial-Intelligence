1. Have one .txt input file with data in the same format as in the problems within the same directory of the codes. Name it for example as "front-input.txt".
2. Use cmd terminal and type:
   i. for running frontend: python frontend.py < front-input.txt
   ii. for running dpll: python dpll.py < dpll-input.txt
   iii. for running backend: python backend.py < backend-input.txt
3. Both .txt files used in dpll.py and backend.py will be generated by previous programmes, but can pass in self-written files as long as names match.
4. There is one result.txt generated as the output and the backend.py also prints the output in the terminal.
5. Have a good day!
